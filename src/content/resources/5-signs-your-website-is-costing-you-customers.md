Most small business owners don’t realize their website is hurting them.

It might not be broken.  
It might even “look fine.”

But subtle issues can quietly cost you customers.

Here are five warning signs.

---

## 1. It Looks Outdated

Design trends change.

If your website feels 5–10 years old, visitors notice.

And when a website feels outdated, people assume:

- The business might be outdated  
- The company might not be active  
- The service quality might not be modern  

First impressions matter.

---

## 2. It’s Hard to Use on a Phone

More than half of your visitors are likely on mobile.

If people have to:

- Pinch to zoom  
- Scroll awkwardly  
- Search for contact info  

They leave.

A professional website should feel smooth on every device.

---

## 3. It’s Confusing

If visitors can’t quickly answer:

- What do you do?
- Who is this for?
- How do I contact you?

They won’t stay.

Clarity builds trust.

Confusion kills it.

## 4. It Loads Slowly

Slow websites feel unprofessional.

Even a few seconds of delay increases drop-offs.

Visitors don’t wait.

They move to the next option.

---

## 5. You Avoid Sending People to It

Here’s the biggest sign:

If you hesitate to send someone your website link…

You already know something needs improvement.

Your website should feel like an asset — not something you’re embarrassed by.

---

## The Real Cost of a Weak Website

A weak website doesn’t just look bad.

It:

- Reduces inquiries  
- Lowers credibility  
- Makes marketing harder  
- Hurts local visibility  

For small businesses in Ozaukee County and the Milwaukee area, your website is often the first impression people get.

Make it count.
