If you’ve searched for website pricing, you’ve probably seen everything from $299 to $15,000+.

So what does a small business website *actually* cost in Wisconsin?

The honest answer: it depends on scope — but here’s a realistic breakdown.

---

## Budget Websites ($300–$1,000)

These are typically:

- DIY platforms  
- Template-based builds  
- Minimal customization  
- Limited support  

They can work for very early-stage businesses.

But they often lack:

- Clear messaging structure  
- Professional polish  
- Long-term flexibility  

---

## Professional Small Business Websites ($2,500–$6,000)

This is where most established local businesses land.

At this level, you typically get:

- Custom structure around your services  
- Mobile-friendly design  
- Clear call-to-action flow  
- Clean, professional presentation  
- Launch support  

For businesses in Ozaukee County and the Milwaukee area, this is the most common investment range.

## Advanced Builds ($8,000+)

These include:

- Complex features  
- Advanced integrations  
- Multi-layered functionality  
- Custom workflows  

Not every business needs this.

But some do.

## What Impacts the Price?

### Scope

How many pages?  
How complex is the structure?

### Content

Are you providing copy and photos?  
Or does it need refinement?

### Features

Simple informational site?  
Or booking, dashboards, portals?

### Ongoing Support

Some businesses prefer one-time builds.

Others choose ongoing support so the site keeps improving over time.

## Why Extremely Cheap Websites Can Cost More Later

Low-cost builds often lead to:

- Rebuilding within 1–2 years  
- Poor local visibility  
- Missed customer inquiries  
- Constant patchwork fixes  

A clear, well-structured site built properly once is often more cost-effective long-term.
