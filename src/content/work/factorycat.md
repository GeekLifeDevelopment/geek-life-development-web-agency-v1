## Goal

Create a modern marketing site that is easier to maintain, easier to extend, and clearer for visitors to navigate.

## Role

In-house developer (employee) — owned and implemented the build.

## Build Notes

Built while employed at FactoryCat. This was an in-house website rebuild led and implemented by me, focused on component-based architecture, responsive implementation, and structured content sections that support ongoing updates.

## Stack

React with modern frontend tooling, component-driven development patterns, and maintainability-focused implementation decisions.

## Highlights

- Consistent component patterns for faster internal updates
- Improved maintainability through clearer section architecture
- Modern responsive UI with cleaner hierarchy and spacing
- Practical content structure that scales with new marketing needs
