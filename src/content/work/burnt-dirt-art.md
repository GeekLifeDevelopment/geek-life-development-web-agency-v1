## Goal

Showcase artwork clearly, improve navigation across collections, and make inquiries easy from any device.

## Role

Design and development.

## Build Notes

The build focused on responsive layout behavior, performance-first structure, SEO fundamentals, and clear call-to-action placement. Content sections were arranged to keep artwork front and center while preserving context for visitors.

## Stack

Modern static-first site build aligned with this project’s approach: Astro, Tailwind CSS, and component-based page sections.

## Highlights

- Mobile polish for browsing artwork comfortably on smaller screens
- Clean gallery presentation with consistent spacing and hierarchy
- Fast-loading page structure with lightweight implementation choices
- Clear contact path for inquiries and project conversations
