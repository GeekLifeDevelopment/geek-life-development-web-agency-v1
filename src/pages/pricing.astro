    question: 'Do we need to pick a tier immediately?',
    answer: 'No. We can scope your project around current priorities and map to a tier later.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we phase the engagement over time?',
    answer: 'Yes. Most clients start with a focused phase and expand once early goals are achieved.'

    question: 'What does pricing depend on?',
    answer: 'Scope complexity, page count, required integrations, and timeline urgency.'
